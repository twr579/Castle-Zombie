# Castle Zombie
Castle Zombie is a first-person shooter video game programmed in C++ on a LaunchPad TM4C123 microcontroller. It consists of a move phase in which the player holds down a button 
to move through an endless hallway and a zombie phase in which the player aims and fires at zombies before they advance and attack. Castle Zombie uses two pushbuttons and a slide 
potentiometer for player input, an LCD for graphical output, and a stereo jack for sound output.
